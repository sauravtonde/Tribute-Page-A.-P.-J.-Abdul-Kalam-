          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>

          <p>
            Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam (Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam) was born
            on 15th October 1931 in the temple town of Rameswaram, located in
            Tamil Nadu. He was born to a very poor Tamil Muslim family. His
            father was a boatman, and an imam in a local mosque, and his mother
            was a housewife. Due to poverty, Dr. Abdul Kalam had to sell
            newspapers in his early childhood to run his family, but he was a
            hardworking and sharp student. He started his schooling from
            Schwartz Higher School in Ramanathapuram. He then moved on to
            complete his graduation in physics from the University of Madras and
            after that to study aerospace technology from the Madras Institute
            of Technology. Dr. Kalam started his career as a scientist from the
            Aeronautical Development Establishment of DRDO and worked under the
            eminent scientist Vikram Sarabhai. He started his contribution as a
            scientist in 1969 when he was the project director of India’s first
            satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) was used to launch the satellite
            Rohini in 1980 and is considered the developer of the Polar
            Satellite Launch Vehicle. He also played a crucial role in the
            development of Agni and Prithvi missiles. Dr. Kalam was the Chief
            Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister in 1992 when the Pokhran-II
            nuclear tests were conducted. In 2002, Dr. Kalam was elected as the
            11th President of India. He had received the title of ‘People’s
            President.’ During his tenure as President, he had rejected the
            mercy plea of the Dhananjoy Chatterjee, convicted of brutal rape and
            murder. He was only the third President to be awarded the Bharat
            Ratna. He also imposed President’s rule in Bihar in 2005. However,
            he did not file for Presidency for a second term and instead
            returned to the field of academics and continued to do so till his
            death in 2015.
